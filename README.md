# Custom HTML Tag

A JavaScript mini-project to create a custom HTML element.

In one of the JavaScript classes, we learned about shadow DOM, and how to create custom HTML tags, in combination of using modules in JavaScript. It is very interesting to look at this project now as I am learning React to see how similar some of the code is. Well, it is not overly surprising, since React is a JavaScript library.

I modified my original assignment submission, to create an element that also possible to close on mouse click to hide from the page.
